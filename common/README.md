#### COMMON PLAIN ES6 

If we write most of the logic code in plain es6 classes, they can be easily imported into projects built on popular javascript libraries like React, Angular, or Ember.

This would be the beginning of turning it into a possible library and/or npm module. 


#### READ ONLY

Please do not edit files in this directory. We use Gulp to identify common files in our app and copy them to this folder. 

See: gulpfile.js in examples > react > terrain-create-react-app 

For instance, I'm working on TerrainViewController.js is a plain es6 class and could eventually be moved here once it's completely ported to es6.
